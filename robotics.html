                        This project involved the implementation of a variety of efficient controls 
                        and estimators for a self-driving vehicle. Ultimately, I ended up implementing a PID controller,
                        an LQR controller, MPC. Each controller was tested and graphed to compare. The MPC controller resulted in 
                        the fastest reflexive control, yielding in a completion of the track in under 128 seconds.

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                        I began by tuning the proportional, integral and derivative gains to optimize PID performance. Next, since 
                        longitudinal control varies the speed, I linearized the lateral control, or turning, using pole placement. 
                        I discretized my model and then implemented LQR, which after tuning achieved a speed of under 130 seconds,  
                        rewarding me with an additional 10 points extra credit for this project. I was able to achieve this speed
                        by tuning how far ahead the vehicle looked, which gave the vehicle more time to react to the updated information.

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                        I also implemented path planning algorithms and estimators, such as A Star and EKF SLAM. A Star was used to replan
                        a trajectory when a slow moving car posed as an "obstacle" ahead. A Star allowed my vehicle to overtake the slower 
                        vehicle in the straight. EKF SLAM was used as an estimator to determine the rough position and heading of the vehicle.

                        Constructed a SO-100 robot arm, calibrated to be in line with the leader arm configuration. Trained using teleoperation, then filters 
                        were added to reduce joint trembling and increase speed. SO-100 was able to autonomously pick up a pen within the reachable workspace, 
                        draw a dollar sign, and put the pen back down. Techniques like frame skipping were experimented to double the task speed.

                        Team was given all components to construct the SO-100 robot arm, including motors, controllers, 3D printed components, and cameras. 
                        We spent the first 4-5 hours formulating a plan for what to do with the robot, construction, and calibration of the robot. During 
                        training, we noticed lots of noise in the trained policy which prevented the pen from being picked up.

                        Using the curves obtained from the leader and follower configuration, we were able to subtract the two to isolate most of the 
                        electrical noise in the system. Using a low pass filter, this noise was greatly reduced, and using "frame skipping" where we 
                        fed every other frame as a command to the robot doubled its speed. My team won the $1,000 prize for the "Most Innovative Use of Data".

                        This project was an exernal device aimed at assisting type III SMA patients with sit to stand transitions. 
                        This device autonomously detected when the user wanted to stand, actuated a spring tied to a spool, and a 
                        cable routed down the wearers' leg pulled them up. Achieved 10% assistance, which beat out the 3-4% of the 
                        previous iteration's design with a great reduction in size. Total volume decreased by 17%, width decreased 28%. 
                        Final prototype was sturdier and relocated to the sides, which was more realistic for a wearer (They can now

                        The challenge with this project was the use of a single motor to actuate both the charging mechanism 
                        for the spring and the turning of a cam to change the state. This was done using a geared switching mechanism
                        on the motor to switch between the camshaft and the powershaft. Two leads were used to reduce the distance needed
                        to travel from one shaft to the other. 
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                        To autonomously detect a STS transition, we ran testing using a motion capture setup with cameras and markers routed
                        in the same areas as a cable would be routed down a patient's leg. I took these points in 3D space and created a 3D
                        spline through them, which interpolated between the points. These splines were discretized and summed to give a good
                        approximation as to how much the length of the cable changed from sitting to standing. We then compared this data to 
                        data found in a paper that determined the point of maximum knee torque, and actuated the mechanism at that point.

                        The first project shows a resolved rates simulation, which were implemented for link speed optimization. Inverse kinematics via a closed loop resolved rates algorithm 
                        enabled the robot to adhere to speed constraints (1mm tolerance translation, 0.0524 radians rotational). These results were simualted via 1st order interpolation in MATLAB.

                        My second project involved using both the gradient of a curve and the Jacobian projected into the null space to allow the end effector to maintain orthogonality to a surface. 
                        Robot links and movement were simulated in MATLAB with a minimum norm pseudoinverse redundancy resolution algorithm. Maintaining this orthogonality to a surface is highly 
                        applicable in welding or writing applications.

                        Data was collected using a webcam overlooking foam cubes scattered across the workspace. These images were 
                        annotated in Roboflow, then exported and trained using YOLOv8. Since the dataset was small, there was a lower 
                        confidence in colors close to the table, such as orange or yellow. Colors with higher contrast were identifiable
                        with a higher confidence and were used instead. The center of the bounding box was found using OpenCV, and the 
                        coordinates were parameterized and scaled to fit the workspace. The joint angles were also interpolated, which 
                        worked for this case but for other cases resolved rates algorithm would be more generalizable.

                        which sent the robot commands to the robot to operate in the workspace.

                        This device was designed to alleviate joint pain and rebuild hand/forearm strength. Applications could be in 
                        PT clinics or doctors offices to test and monitor grip strength and document effectiveness. The device used a 
                        PIC16F88 microcontroller, programmed in PICBasic Pro. Polling used to detect when the limit switch was triggered,
                        which activates a buzzer and a rep count is displayed on an LCD. A challenge faced was coding the force; "ADCIN" was 
                        needed instead of the "Pot" function to read the potentiometer output and translate the force.

                        its jaws, with a PWM signal from the Arduino sent to a motor controller to actuate the jaws. The Arduino was 
                        bcontrolled by a digital IO on the robot flange, which allowed for a direct connection with the robot.
