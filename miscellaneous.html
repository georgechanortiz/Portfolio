                        First big project in the PROOF Lab, I was tasked with building a base for the robot to be mounted on. Made from 
                        8020 extrusions, calculations made with the maximum payload in mind to ensure that the robot would not tip over 
                        from use over edge. Constructed base and supervised installation of it onto the robot.

                        Obtained an STL model of the robot, which helped with creating the base. Custom plates needed to be designed to 
                        create the angular truss which prevented twist and kept the frame square. Over 200 screws were used in assembly, and 
                        the plates were machined by me in the machine shop. I also drilled holes in the top plates to accept screws into the 
                        8020s. THe power supply was fitted underneath the base, and weights were added on the base in the form of 45lb gym plates.

                        of sodium citrate solution. Resulted in nanoparticles of different sizes, which because of refractive properties 
                        changed the color of solution. Implemented at a cost of under 1 dollar per student. I presented my findings at the

                        Gold (III) chloride is diluted using distilled water. When constantly stirred with diluted sodium citrate under heat, 
                        the solution turns from yellow to gray, then to red or purple, which indicates the formation of these nanoparticles. 
                        The heat and duration of mixing were changed and tested for observable diffrences in color or size. Best results were
                        with changing the concentration of sodium citrate, which yielded a difference in about 50nm.

                        The sizes were tested and confirmed with a Scanning Electron Microscope, which I was trained to use. Samples needed to be
                        pipetted onto a SEM stand with a silicon wafer, and dried properly. The samples were then observed under the SEM. The 
                        color of the solution was also quantified using Spectrophotometry, which outputs a wavelength of color. These findings 
                        were enough to establish a relationship between concentration and size.

                        quarantine project. Power tools seemed a bit intimidating and extremely wasteful when making Kumiko, as the kerf from a
                        table saw blade rivals the thickness of a single Kumiko strip. I resorted to hand cutting and planing each piece down to 
                        size, and gluing up all the joints.

                        Spray adhesive was applied to the back to accept the shoji paper, which was carefully laid onto the kumiko and allowed to dry. 
                        Dabs of hot glue secure the panels onto the walnut frame, for easy replacability in case a panel breaks.

                        I wanted to create a block plane using brass and steel for my woodworking projects. The machine shop at Stevens taught

                        carve out rounded dovetails, and machined components.

                        pictures can be seen below. All components are separate, but about a month of hard work and learning went into 
                        machining the body so I am a bit hesitant to make the connections permanent in case something goes wrong. I also still 
                        need to find or make a blade for the plane, as my custom width plane is more narrow than other blades and will require a 
                        custom one to be made and heat treated to retain a sharp edge.

                <h2>Doosan H2515 Robot - Base</h2>
                <h4>My first project in the PROOF Lab was to build a base for the robot to sit on. Made from 8020 extrusions, calculations made 
                with max payload in mind to ensure that the robot would not tip over. Supervised installation of robot onto base. </h4>

                <h4>Got an opportunity to work on developing labs for E311 at Stevens over Summer 2023, a materials processing course. 
                Created gold nanoparticles using the Turkevich method and adjusted the size of the nanoparticles through adjusting the 
                concentration of sodium citrate solution. </h4>

                Box designed to hold 6 watches comfortably, poplar was chosen as inner liner for its softer properties. </h4>

                to map to certain functions. For example, the weather function uses a weather API call to return the temperature and forecast of a preset location unless specified 
                otherwise. Other functions include a random number generator, timer, and search function. </h4>

                <h2>Fixture for Holding Castings During Cutting Operation</h2>
                <h4>Cutting operations for machine operators was manual, creating a dangerous work environment. Fixture was designed in Siemens NX and constructed from steel. 
                GD&T principles employed for drawings; machinists were super helpful in guiding me through  machining tolerances. Final fixture deployed on floor, safely 
                securing tibial casting and resulting in hands-free operation. Swappable fixture allows fixtures for other part families to be used.  </h4>
